They are mostly near the constalation Segotarious. WR104 is the one closest to us and if and when it explodes it could be targeting our planet, the radiation come crack a hole in our ozone layer which could make many species extinct including ours. There are millions of Death Star in our universe. Death Stars are like giant nuclear bombs in the universe. Deaths stars explode in to a \"stellar after life.\" There explosions can blow up to be almost as big as a planet. How they blow up is because the thing that contains them slowly disappears and when it's gone all the gravity pushes everything to the middle and the Death Star explodes. If one targets earth with enough force it is possible that it could go right through the ozone layer and hit the earth. That is what could happen with WR104. WR104 is like a real Death Star from Star Wars but much scarier. WR104 is  something we call Wolf-Rayat Star. WR104 is next to a star called a Binary System Star. Both stars orbit each other, and these space wind degrad the mass from one star and the mass that is taken away  God to the other star next to it and the star that took all that mass from the other star is usually the star that explodes. There is a dust spiral that works like a giant spider that shoots water from one side and because it is spinning it becomes a spiral. The bigger the Death Star the faster less time it needs to explodes. Wr104 would explode in about a few hundred years and when it does it could be a Gamma-Rayat Burst. A GRB is triggered by the crushing transformation of a dieing star.","height":1292,"lastEdited":0,"rotation":"0.0","type":"txt","uuid":"553e5ade39a868401b000001-txtitem","width":528,"x":246,"y":331},{"_id":{"$oid": "553e5d4ae1b8325b25000cdb"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/rcwylzln9c.png","type":"img","uuid":"553e5d363d1561355e000035-mediaitem"},{"_id":{"$oid": "553932dce1b8325b25000c9e"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/px3k32m80.jpg","height":372,"lastEdited":0,"rotation":"0.0","type":"img","uuid":"553932c7f079d013c8000005-mediaitem","width":281,"x":438,"y":236},{"_id":{"$oid": "55393d74e1b8325b25000ca8"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/23chp6cdreo.jpg","height":319,"lastEdited":0,"rotation":"0.0","type":"img","uuid":"55393cdc91291402f0000001-mediaitem","width":571,"x":400,"y":482},{"_id":{"$oid": "553e5a28e1b8325b25000cc3"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1xrovnaqqrk.jpg","height":364,"lastEdited":0,"rotation":"0.0","type":"img","uuid":"553e5a0848cedc1330000000-mediaitem","width":486,"x":239,"y":208},{"_id":{"$oid": "553e5c0fe1b8325b25000ccd"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/57fsg6u60w.jpg","height":490,"lastEdited":0,"rotation":"0.0","type":"img","uuid":"553e5bdf48cedc3c69000007-mediaitem","width":401,"x":499,"y":-20},{"_id":{"$oid": "553e5eb2e1b8325b25000ce5"},"content":"The Fermi Gamma Ray","height":35,"lastEdited":0,"rotation":"0.0","type":"txt","uuid":"553e5e9848cedc6db800002a-txtitem","width":600,"x":37,"y":550},{"_id":{"$oid": "553e5eb2e1b8325b25000ce6"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/20pi1u2tfy8.jpg","height":262,"lastEdited":0,"rotation":"0.0","type":"img","uuid":"553e5e9848cedc6db800002a-mediaitem","width":827,"x":264,"y":495},{"_id":{"$oid": "553e6319e1b8325b25000cf5"},"content":"- They made something called fermi gamma ray telescopeto detect dark matter, it detects gamma radiation- dark matter is gamma"

But even then, life will not necessarily happen. There is another thing too. Life has to happen. Steven Hawking made a speech about life, and he goes into great detail. But a certain random thing has to happen for life to happen. This reaction goes against enormous odds to happen, and it was extremely unlikely to happen here. But there is some principle mentioned by Steven Hawking, explaining that if we were on a different planet, we would be wondering the same thing. Back to the reaction. When it happens on a habitable planet, single cellular life can come into being, after which life will evolve and become more advanced, from single celled to millions of cells.

The first person to discover dark matter was Fritz Zwicky, who was an astronomer from Switzerland. We know that mass bends light. The gravitational field of a massive object will extend far into space, and cause light rays passing close to that object to be bent and refocused somewhere else. The more massive the object, the stronger its gravitational field and so the greater the bending of light rays. Using the 340-megapixel camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) on Mauna Kea Mountain in Hawaii, scientists studied the gravitational lensing effects of 10 million galaxies in four different regions of the sky over a period of five years. When they stitched everything together, they had a picture of dark matter looking across 1 billion light-years of space - the largest map of the invisible stuff produced to date.\n\n      The ratio of dark matter to visible matter is 10:1! Dark matter makes up 23% of the universe whereas ordinary matter makes up only 4% . Dark matter effects galaxies movements. If galaxies didn't have dark matter to assist them they would rotate too fast. In other words dark matter makes sure galaxies do not rotate to fast by slowing them down.\n\n      Dark matter passes through the earth \"billions of particles at a time.\" Because dark matter is passing through the earth \"billions of particles at a time\" some of you might be wondering why can't we see it? That is because dark matter is an invisible substance. Some scientists who are working with a company called Fermilab are trying to capture dark matter in a substance called geranium the geranium is in a puck like shape. The dark matter will hopefully one day pass through the geranium puck and heat it up a tad because the geranium puck is frozen. Unfortunatly the propability of dark matter to pass through the geranium puck is like an archer trying to hit a bullseye a mile away.\n\n      Nobody knows what dark matter really is. Other candidates are figments of scientific imagination. One of the candidates are WIMPs (which stands for weakly interacting massive particles), and if they exist, these particles have masses tens or hundreds of times greater than that of a proton but interact so weakly with ordinary matter that they're difficult to detect.","height":1064,"lastEdited":0,"rotation":"0.0","type":"txt","uuid":"554ba40b5f740e680800000a-txtitem","width":307,"x":1612,"y":21},{"_id":{"$oid": "554ba5d1e1b8325b25000f1e"},"content":" NASA has found a planet that could potentially have life.

In March 1610, he published a small booklet, The Starry Messenger, revealing his discoveries that the moon was not flat and smooth, but a sphere with mountains and craters. He found Venus had phases like the moon, proving it rotated around the sun. He also discovered Jupiter had revolving moons, which did not revolve around the earth. In 1612, he published his Discourse on Bodies in Water, refuting the Aristotelian explanation of why objects float in water, saying that it was not because of their flat shape, but instead the weight of the object in relation to the water it displaced.
