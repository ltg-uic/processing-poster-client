They are mostly near the constalation Segotarious. WR104 is the one closest to us and if and when it explodes it could be targeting our planet, the radiation come crack a hole in our ozone layer which could make many species extinct including ours. There are millions of Death Star in our universe. Death Stars are like giant nuclear bombs in the universe. Deaths stars explode in to a \"stellar after life.\" There explosions can blow up to be almost as big as a planet. How they blow up is because the thing that contains them slowly disappears and when it's gone all the gravity pushes everything to the middle and the Death Star explodes. If one targets earth with enough force it is possible that it could go right through the ozone layer and hit the earth. That is what could happen with WR104. WR104 is like a real Death Star from Star Wars but much scarier. WR104 is  something we call Wolf-Rayat Star. WR104 is next to a star called a Binary System Star. Both stars orbit each other, and these space wind degrad the mass from one star and the mass that is taken away  God to the other star next to it and the star that took all that mass from the other star is usually the star that explodes. There is a dust spiral that works like a giant spider that shoots water from one side and because it is spinning it becomes a spiral.

The core gets hotter and hotter, until nuclear reactions begin inside, making the cloud of gases a star.","height":193,"hn":0.23875,"lastEdited":1432222794188,"rotation":"0.0","type":"txt","uuid":"554b83daacba496065000008-txtitem","width":216,"wn":0.16875,"x":326,"xn":0.403125,"y":577,"yn":0.7225},{"_id":{"$oid": "554b8affe1b8325b25000ee6"},"content":"rtrt","type":"txt","uuid":"554b8ab4acba496cc6000015-txtitem"},{"_id":{"$oid": "554b86d9e1b8325b25000ec9"},"content":" The largest black holes are called a supermassive black hole.

Plants would not be able to grow and make oxygen.\n Our planet is the perfect place to support life. The sun is not too far but it is not too close either. If it was too far our water would all freeze, plants would not grow and life could not exist. If we were too close, water would evaporate and all life would burn up.\n\n2. Water is necessary for life to exist on Earth. A liquid is needed for the chemical reaction that would make the earliest form of life. Water also provides life with something to drink.

Imagine you want to investigate a black hole by shining a light towards it and measuring the time that elapses before the light is reflected back to you. Unfortunately, you will be waiting a very long time[0xc3][0xa2][0xc2][0x80][0xc2][0x94]forever, in fact.

The first person to discover dark matter was Fritz Zwicky, who was an astronomer from Switzerland. We know that mass bends light. The gravitational field of a massive object will extend far into space, and cause light rays passing close to that object to be bent and refocused somewhere else. The more massive the object, the stronger its gravitational field and so the greater the bending of light rays. Using the 340-megapixel camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) on Mauna Kea Mountain in Hawaii, scientists studied the gravitational lensing effects of 10 million galaxies in four different regions of the sky over a period of five years. When they stitched everything together, they had a picture of dark matter looking across 1 billion light-years of space - the largest map of the invisible stuff produced to date.\n\n      The ratio of dark matter to visible matter is 10:1! Dark matter makes up 23% of the universe whereas ordinary matter makes up only 4% . Dark matter effects galaxies movements. If galaxies didn't have dark matter to assist them they would rotate too fast. In other words dark matter makes sure galaxies do not rotate to fast by slowing them down.\n\n      Dark matter passes through the earth \"billions of particles at a time.\" Because dark matter is passing through the earth \"billions of particles at a time\" some of you might be wondering why can't we see it? That is because dark matter is an invisible substance. Some scientists who are working with a company called Fermilab are trying to capture dark matter in a substance called geranium the geranium is in a puck like shape. The dark matter will hopefully one day pass through the geranium puck and heat it up a tad because the geranium puck is frozen. Unfortunatly the propability of dark matter to pass through the geranium puck is like an archer trying to hit a bullseye a mile away.\n\n      Nobody knows what dark matter really is. Other candidates are figments of scientific imagination. One of the candidates are WIMPs (which stands for weakly interacting massive particles), and if they exist, these particles have masses tens or hundreds of times greater than that of a proton but interact so weakly with ordinary matter that they're difficult to detect.","height":1064,"hn":1.33,"lastEdited":1431601736680,"rotation":"0.0","type":"txt","uuid":"554ba40b5f740e680800000a-txtitem","width":307,"wn":0.23984375,"x":1612,"xn":1.259375,"y":21,"yn":0.02625},{"_id":{"$oid": "554ba7bce1b8325b25000f26"},"content":" In conclusion,\n\n~Dark matter has a gravitational pull!

In August, he demonstrated it to some Venetian merchants, who saw its value for spotting ships and gave Galileo salary to manufacture several of them. However, Galileo's ambition pushed him to go further, and in the fall of 1609 he made the fateful decision to turn his telescope toward the heavens. In March 1610, he published a small booklet, The Starry Messenger, revealing his discoveries that the moon was not flat and smooth, but a sphere with mountains and craters. He found Venus had phases like the moon, proving it rotated around the sun. He also discovered Jupiter had revolving moons, which did not revolve around the earth. In 1612, he published his Discourse on Bodies in Water, refuting the Aristotelian explanation of why objects float in water, saying that it was not because of their flat shape, but instead the weight of the object in relation to the water it displaced. In 1613, he published his observations of"

Evolved from the Draco Thruster, the SuperDraco Jetpack Engine is extremely powerful and can use fuel for months after takeoff. They can be found in SpaceX's most recent spacecrafts, and can possibly be used for space travel alongside the Ion Thrusters. For example, let's say that a spacecraft has both Ion Thrusters and SuperDraco Jetpack Engines. It could use the SuperDraco Engines to propel itself once it's in space while beginning to use the Ion Thrusters. As a result, it could be extremely fast when it takes off by using half of the fuel for the SuperDraco Engines, while the Ion Thrusters are gradually providing more of a push. Because only half of the fuel for the SuperDraco Engines would be used for the initial boost, when the ship lands, it could use the rest of the fuel for easy landing control.\n            The Draco Rocket Engine Family is SpaceX's group of Draco thrusters, which are hypergolic liquid rocket engines.

Some people say that a few Biospherians smuggled food from the outside, and when the bees they had died cockroaches and ants replaced them.

The sun makes a very big dent, but it is farther away from the earth. The moon makes less of a dent, but it is way closer to the earth. Therefore, when the sun and the moon are in line on either sides of the earth, they are both pulling the earth, and earths water, towards themselves. This is what makes the tides go out. The reason that the water does not just fall straight off the earth is because earth has a dent of its own. Even though it is not that large, it still keeps the water coming back again. The way that it always comes back again is because the earth is spinning and losing line with the sun and the moon while the other parts of the world come into direction.\n ","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:33:18.813Z","height":751,"hn":0.46625,"lastEdited":1432224978722,"type":"txt","uuid":"555dfac1e1b8325b250011aa","width":600,"wn":0.23203125,"x":0,"xn":0.0203125,"y":0,"yn":0.32374996185302735},{"_id":{"$oid": "555df51be1b8325b25001197"},"content":"Blackholes are created when stars collapse.","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:09:35.671Z","height":35,"hn":0.04375,"lastEdited":1432224015334,"type":"txt","uuid":"555df51be1b8325b25001197","width":600,"wn":0.46875,"x":0,"xn":0.021875,"y":0,"yn":0.53125},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfc29e1b8325b250011b1"},"content":"a picture of the universe","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:39:16.920Z","type":"txt","uuid":"555dfc29e1b8325b250011b1"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfccce1b8325b250011b9"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1j373d0uj28.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:42:04.622Z","type":"img","uuid":"555dfccce1b8325b250011b9"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfc6ae1b8325b250011b3"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/uamwfupbeo.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:40:25.571Z","height":445,"hn":0.2212962962962963,"lastEdited":1432226645471,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfc6ae1b8325b250011b3","width":876,"wn":0.2453125,"x":0,"xn":0.20861018498738607,"y":0,"yn":0.7288187662760417},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfcb2e1b8325b250011b4"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1pgon59m1vk.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:41:37.811Z","height":181,"hn":0.22625,"lastEdited":1432224015338,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfcb2e1b8325b250011b4","width":279,"wn":0.21796875,"x":0,"xn":0.30546875,"y":0,"yn":0.25875},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfccce1b8325b250011b7"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/qy1iuhui2o.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:42:04.150Z","height":2448,"hn":0.33625,"lastEdited":1432224015352,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfccce1b8325b250011b7","width":3264,"wn":0.28125,"x":0,"xn":0.64765625,"y":0,"yn":0.01},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfdb1e1b8325b250011c3"},"content":" The universe is expanding into itself, there isn't any outside to the universe it is just space that the universe expanses into.

At an early age, Hawking showed a passion for science and the sky. At age 21, while studying cosmology at the University of Cambridge, he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Despite his debilitating illness, he has done groundbreaking work in physics and cosmology, and his several books have helped to make science accessible to everyone. Part of his life story was depicted in the 2014 film The Theory of Everything.\n\n- Groundbreaking findings from another young cosmologist, Roger Penrose, about the fate of stars and the creation of black holes tapped into Hawking's own fascination with how the universe began. This set him on a career course that reshaped the way the world thinks about black holes and the universe.\n\n- In 1974, Hawking's research turned him into a celebrity within the scientific world when he showed that black holes aren't the information vacuums that scientists had thought they were. In simple terms, Hawking demonstrated that matter, in the form of radiation, can escape the gravitational force of a collapsed star. Hawking radiation was born.\n\nWhat awards he has won: \nPresidential Medal of Freedom, Copley Medal, Wolf Prize in Physics, Fonseca Prize, Albert Einstein Award (twice!), Adams Prize, Gold Medal of the royal astronomical Society, Hughes Medal, eddington, Dannie Heineman Prize mathematical Physics, Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics and Life Sciences, Prince of asturias award for Concord, and dirac medal of the institute of Physics.","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:49:07.523Z","type":"txt","uuid":"555dfe73e1b8325b250011cd"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfcfbe1b8325b250011ba"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/qi0o97zkzk.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:42:50.144Z","height":227,"hn":0.17592592592592593,"lastEdited":1432226645460,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfcfbe1b8325b250011ba","width":350,"wn":0.15260416666666668,"x":0,"xn":0.20787722269694012,"y":0,"yn":0.16329284950538916},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfe72e1b8325b250011cb"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/c13079qu4g.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:49:04.025Z","height":1600,"hn":0.4759259259259259,"lastEdited":1432226645475,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfe72e1b8325b250011cb","width":2560,"wn":0.428125,"x":0,"xn":0.4839574178059896,"y":0,"yn":0.5712296097366898},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfe96e1b8325b250011ce"},"content":" - URANUS - Uranus was discovered  By Sir Williams Hershel -\n He was one of the most famous astronomers of the 18th century - \nHershel Discovered it with his hand crafted telescope 1781 - \nWilliams was a german born British - \nHe found Uranus and its two moons - \n\nUranus is known as the ice giant - \nIt takes 84 earth years to orbit the sun - \nIt's tempratures can be 216 C, making it the coldest of the major planets.","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:49:42.892Z","type":"txt","uuid":"555dfe96e1b8325b250011ce"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfefbe1b8325b250011d0"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1vpkpg96cxs.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:51:23.237Z","height":85,"hn":0.1475,"lastEdited":1432224015357,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfefbe1b8325b250011d0","width":81,"wn":0.08828125,"x":0,"xn":0.06667542457580566,"y":0,"yn":0.013468754291534425},{"_id":{"$oid": "555e0247e1b8325b250011d6"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/yprv046qkg.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T16:05:26.915Z","height":1024,"hn":0.36875,"lastEdited":1432224978697,"type":"img","uuid":"555e0247e1b8325b250011d6","width":748,"wn":0.16796875,"x":0,"xn":0.22845540046691895,"y":0,"yn":0.06930117130279541},{"_id":{"$oid": "555e00b7e1b8325b250011d4"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/v4syoi5vcw.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:58:46.945Z","height":1004,"hn":0.3075,"lastEdited":1432224978718,"type":"img","uuid":"555e00b7e1b8325b250011d4","width":832,"wn":0.159375,"x":0,"xn":0.6150905609130859,"y":0,"yn":0.3407368469238281},{"_id":{"$oid": "5554e48be1b8325b2500115d"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1oecqto579c.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-14T18:08:10.731Z","height":1536,"hn":0.2638888888888889,"lastEdited":1432234632252,"type":"img","uuid":"5554e48be1b8325b2500115d","width":2048,"wn":0.19791666666666666,"x":0,"xn":0.7770833333333333,"y":0,"yn":0.025925925925925925},{"_id":{"$oid": "5554e4a8e1b8325b2500115e"},"content":" www.seti.org\nyoutube\nwww.nasa.com\nwww.planet.com\nwww.universetoday.com\nhttp://ocean.si.edu/ocean-videos/hydrothermal-vent-creatures\nwww.space.com\n","created_at":"2015-05-14T18:08:40.021Z","height":143,"hn":0.0962962962962963,"lastEdited":1432234632258,"type":"txt","uuid":"5554e4a8e1b8325b2500115e","width":600,"wn":0.23020833333333332,"x":0,"xn":0.0203125,"y":0,"yn":0.8379629629629629},{"_id":{"$oid": "5554e6efe1b8325b25001170"},"content":" We don't know 100% that there actually is life in space. we have though about it but we can't come to the conclusion that there is life in space.

The sun is the main reason why life exists on Earth. Without the sun Earth would too cold to support life. All the water would freeze up. Plants would not be able to grow and make oxygen.\n Our planet is the perfect place to support life. The sun is not too far but it is not too close either. If it was too far our water would all freeze, plants would not grow and life could not exist. If we were too close, water would evaporate and all life would burn up.\n\n2. Water is necessary for life to exist on Earth. A liquid is needed for the chemical reaction that would make the earliest form of life. Water also provides life with something to drink. If we couldn't drink anything we would die within a week.\n\n3. Plants and trees produce oxygen. If there were no trees/plants then we would run out of oxygen, which we need to breathe. Plants also provide food for animals as well as us. We also eat animals. If there were no plants then the animals would run out of food and die. This would also make us starve because there would  be no more animals or plants to eat.\n\n4. All planets must have an atmosphere in order for life to survive. The atmosphere would protect the planet from asteroids, comets, harmful radiation, solar flares, meteors and other harmful things from space.

They are mostly near the constalation Segotarious. WR104 is the one closest to us and if and when it explodes it could be targeting our planet, the radiation come crack a hole in our ozone layer which could make many species extinct including ours. There are millions of Death Star in our universe. Death Stars are like giant nuclear bombs in the universe. Deaths stars explode in to a \"stellar after life.\" There explosions can blow up to be almost as big as a planet. How they blow up is because the thing that contains them slowly disappears and when it's gone all the gravity pushes everything to the middle and the Death Star explodes. If one targets earth with enough force it is possible that it could go right through the ozone layer and hit the earth. That is what could happen with WR104. WR104 is like a real Death Star from Star Wars but much scarier. WR104 is  something we call Wolf-Rayat Star. WR104 is next to a star called a Binary System Star. Both stars orbit each other, and these space wind degrad the mass from one star and the mass that is taken away  God to the other star next to it and the star that took all that mass from the other star is usually the star that explodes. There is a dust spiral that works like a giant spider that shoots water from one side and because it is spinning it becomes a spiral.

The core gets hotter and hotter, until nuclear reactions begin inside, making the cloud of gases a star.","height":193,"hn":0.23875,"lastEdited":1432222794188,"rotation":"0.0","type":"txt","uuid":"554b83daacba496065000008-txtitem","width":216,"wn":0.16875,"x":326,"xn":0.403125,"y":577,"yn":0.7225},{"_id":{"$oid": "554b8affe1b8325b25000ee6"},"content":"rtrt","type":"txt","uuid":"554b8ab4acba496cc6000015-txtitem"},{"_id":{"$oid": "554b86d9e1b8325b25000ec9"},"content":" The largest black holes are called a supermassive black hole.

Plants would not be able to grow and make oxygen.\n Our planet is the perfect place to support life. The sun is not too far but it is not too close either. If it was too far our water would all freeze, plants would not grow and life could not exist. If we were too close, water would evaporate and all life would burn up.\n\n2. Water is necessary for life to exist on Earth. A liquid is needed for the chemical reaction that would make the earliest form of life. Water also provides life with something to drink.

Imagine you want to investigate a black hole by shining a light towards it and measuring the time that elapses before the light is reflected back to you. Unfortunately, you will be waiting a very long time[0xc3][0xa2][0xc2][0x80][0xc2][0x94]forever, in fact.

The first person to discover dark matter was Fritz Zwicky, who was an astronomer from Switzerland. We know that mass bends light. The gravitational field of a massive object will extend far into space, and cause light rays passing close to that object to be bent and refocused somewhere else. The more massive the object, the stronger its gravitational field and so the greater the bending of light rays. Using the 340-megapixel camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) on Mauna Kea Mountain in Hawaii, scientists studied the gravitational lensing effects of 10 million galaxies in four different regions of the sky over a period of five years. When they stitched everything together, they had a picture of dark matter looking across 1 billion light-years of space - the largest map of the invisible stuff produced to date.\n\n      The ratio of dark matter to visible matter is 10:1! Dark matter makes up 23% of the universe whereas ordinary matter makes up only 4% . Dark matter effects galaxies movements. If galaxies didn't have dark matter to assist them they would rotate too fast. In other words dark matter makes sure galaxies do not rotate to fast by slowing them down.\n\n      Dark matter passes through the earth \"billions of particles at a time.\" Because dark matter is passing through the earth \"billions of particles at a time\" some of you might be wondering why can't we see it? That is because dark matter is an invisible substance. Some scientists who are working with a company called Fermilab are trying to capture dark matter in a substance called geranium the geranium is in a puck like shape. The dark matter will hopefully one day pass through the geranium puck and heat it up a tad because the geranium puck is frozen. Unfortunatly the propability of dark matter to pass through the geranium puck is like an archer trying to hit a bullseye a mile away.\n\n      Nobody knows what dark matter really is. Other candidates are figments of scientific imagination. One of the candidates are WIMPs (which stands for weakly interacting massive particles), and if they exist, these particles have masses tens or hundreds of times greater than that of a proton but interact so weakly with ordinary matter that they're difficult to detect.","height":1064,"hn":1.33,"lastEdited":1431601736680,"rotation":"0.0","type":"txt","uuid":"554ba40b5f740e680800000a-txtitem","width":307,"wn":0.23984375,"x":1612,"xn":1.259375,"y":21,"yn":0.02625},{"_id":{"$oid": "554ba7bce1b8325b25000f26"},"content":" In conclusion,\n\n~Dark matter has a gravitational pull!

In August, he demonstrated it to some Venetian merchants, who saw its value for spotting ships and gave Galileo salary to manufacture several of them. However, Galileo's ambition pushed him to go further, and in the fall of 1609 he made the fateful decision to turn his telescope toward the heavens. In March 1610, he published a small booklet, The Starry Messenger, revealing his discoveries that the moon was not flat and smooth, but a sphere with mountains and craters. He found Venus had phases like the moon, proving it rotated around the sun. He also discovered Jupiter had revolving moons, which did not revolve around the earth. In 1612, he published his Discourse on Bodies in Water, refuting the Aristotelian explanation of why objects float in water, saying that it was not because of their flat shape, but instead the weight of the object in relation to the water it displaced. In 1613, he published his observations of"

Evolved from the Draco Thruster, the SuperDraco Jetpack Engine is extremely powerful and can use fuel for months after takeoff. They can be found in SpaceX's most recent spacecrafts, and can possibly be used for space travel alongside the Ion Thrusters. For example, let's say that a spacecraft has both Ion Thrusters and SuperDraco Jetpack Engines. It could use the SuperDraco Engines to propel itself once it's in space while beginning to use the Ion Thrusters. As a result, it could be extremely fast when it takes off by using half of the fuel for the SuperDraco Engines, while the Ion Thrusters are gradually providing more of a push. Because only half of the fuel for the SuperDraco Engines would be used for the initial boost, when the ship lands, it could use the rest of the fuel for easy landing control.\n            The Draco Rocket Engine Family is SpaceX's group of Draco thrusters, which are hypergolic liquid rocket engines.

Some people say that a few Biospherians smuggled food from the outside, and when the bees they had died cockroaches and ants replaced them.

The sun makes a very big dent, but it is farther away from the earth. The moon makes less of a dent, but it is way closer to the earth. Therefore, when the sun and the moon are in line on either sides of the earth, they are both pulling the earth, and earths water, towards themselves. This is what makes the tides go out. The reason that the water does not just fall straight off the earth is because earth has a dent of its own. Even though it is not that large, it still keeps the water coming back again. The way that it always comes back again is because the earth is spinning and losing line with the sun and the moon while the other parts of the world come into direction.\n ","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:33:18.813Z","height":751,"hn":0.46625,"lastEdited":1432224978722,"type":"txt","uuid":"555dfac1e1b8325b250011aa","width":600,"wn":0.23203125,"x":0,"xn":0.0203125,"y":0,"yn":0.32374996185302735},{"_id":{"$oid": "555df51be1b8325b25001197"},"content":"Blackholes are created when stars collapse.","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:09:35.671Z","height":35,"hn":0.04375,"lastEdited":1432224015334,"type":"txt","uuid":"555df51be1b8325b25001197","width":600,"wn":0.46875,"x":0,"xn":0.021875,"y":0,"yn":0.53125},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfc29e1b8325b250011b1"},"content":"a picture of the universe","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:39:16.920Z","type":"txt","uuid":"555dfc29e1b8325b250011b1"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfccce1b8325b250011b9"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1j373d0uj28.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:42:04.622Z","type":"img","uuid":"555dfccce1b8325b250011b9"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfc6ae1b8325b250011b3"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/uamwfupbeo.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:40:25.571Z","height":445,"hn":0.2212962962962963,"lastEdited":1432226645471,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfc6ae1b8325b250011b3","width":876,"wn":0.2453125,"x":0,"xn":0.20861018498738607,"y":0,"yn":0.7288187662760417},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfcb2e1b8325b250011b4"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1pgon59m1vk.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:41:37.811Z","height":181,"hn":0.22625,"lastEdited":1432224015338,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfcb2e1b8325b250011b4","width":279,"wn":0.21796875,"x":0,"xn":0.30546875,"y":0,"yn":0.25875},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfccce1b8325b250011b7"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/qy1iuhui2o.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:42:04.150Z","height":2448,"hn":0.33625,"lastEdited":1432224015352,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfccce1b8325b250011b7","width":3264,"wn":0.28125,"x":0,"xn":0.64765625,"y":0,"yn":0.01},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfdb1e1b8325b250011c3"},"content":" The universe is expanding into itself, there isn't any outside to the universe it is just space that the universe expanses into.

At an early age, Hawking showed a passion for science and the sky. At age 21, while studying cosmology at the University of Cambridge, he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Despite his debilitating illness, he has done groundbreaking work in physics and cosmology, and his several books have helped to make science accessible to everyone. Part of his life story was depicted in the 2014 film The Theory of Everything.\n\n- Groundbreaking findings from another young cosmologist, Roger Penrose, about the fate of stars and the creation of black holes tapped into Hawking's own fascination with how the universe began. This set him on a career course that reshaped the way the world thinks about black holes and the universe.\n\n- In 1974, Hawking's research turned him into a celebrity within the scientific world when he showed that black holes aren't the information vacuums that scientists had thought they were. In simple terms, Hawking demonstrated that matter, in the form of radiation, can escape the gravitational force of a collapsed star. Hawking radiation was born.\n\nWhat awards he has won: \nPresidential Medal of Freedom, Copley Medal, Wolf Prize in Physics, Fonseca Prize, Albert Einstein Award (twice!), Adams Prize, Gold Medal of the royal astronomical Society, Hughes Medal, eddington, Dannie Heineman Prize mathematical Physics, Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics and Life Sciences, Prince of asturias award for Concord, and dirac medal of the institute of Physics.","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:49:07.523Z","type":"txt","uuid":"555dfe73e1b8325b250011cd"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfcfbe1b8325b250011ba"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/qi0o97zkzk.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:42:50.144Z","height":227,"hn":0.17592592592592593,"lastEdited":1432226645460,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfcfbe1b8325b250011ba","width":350,"wn":0.15260416666666668,"x":0,"xn":0.20787722269694012,"y":0,"yn":0.16329284950538916},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfe72e1b8325b250011cb"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/c13079qu4g.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:49:04.025Z","height":1600,"hn":0.4759259259259259,"lastEdited":1432226645475,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfe72e1b8325b250011cb","width":2560,"wn":0.428125,"x":0,"xn":0.4839574178059896,"y":0,"yn":0.5712296097366898},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfe96e1b8325b250011ce"},"content":" - URANUS - Uranus was discovered  By Sir Williams Hershel -\n He was one of the most famous astronomers of the 18th century - \nHershel Discovered it with his hand crafted telescope 1781 - \nWilliams was a german born British - \nHe found Uranus and its two moons - \n\nUranus is known as the ice giant - \nIt takes 84 earth years to orbit the sun - \nIt's tempratures can be 216 C, making it the coldest of the major planets.","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:49:42.892Z","type":"txt","uuid":"555dfe96e1b8325b250011ce"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfefbe1b8325b250011d0"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1vpkpg96cxs.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:51:23.237Z","height":85,"hn":0.1475,"lastEdited":1432224015357,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfefbe1b8325b250011d0","width":81,"wn":0.08828125,"x":0,"xn":0.06667542457580566,"y":0,"yn":0.013468754291534425},{"_id":{"$oid": "555e0247e1b8325b250011d6"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/yprv046qkg.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T16:05:26.915Z","height":1024,"hn":0.36875,"lastEdited":1432224978697,"type":"img","uuid":"555e0247e1b8325b250011d6","width":748,"wn":0.16796875,"x":0,"xn":0.22845540046691895,"y":0,"yn":0.06930117130279541},{"_id":{"$oid": "555e00b7e1b8325b250011d4"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/v4syoi5vcw.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:58:46.945Z","height":1004,"hn":0.3075,"lastEdited":1432224978718,"type":"img","uuid":"555e00b7e1b8325b250011d4","width":832,"wn":0.159375,"x":0,"xn":0.6150905609130859,"y":0,"yn":0.3407368469238281},{"_id":{"$oid": "5554e48be1b8325b2500115d"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1oecqto579c.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-14T18:08:10.731Z","height":1536,"hn":0.2638888888888889,"lastEdited":1432234632252,"type":"img","uuid":"5554e48be1b8325b2500115d","width":2048,"wn":0.19791666666666666,"x":0,"xn":0.7770833333333333,"y":0,"yn":0.025925925925925925},{"_id":{"$oid": "5554e4a8e1b8325b2500115e"},"content":" www.seti.org\nyoutube\nwww.nasa.com\nwww.planet.com\nwww.universetoday.com\nhttp://ocean.si.edu/ocean-videos/hydrothermal-vent-creatures\nwww.space.com\n","created_at":"2015-05-14T18:08:40.021Z","height":143,"hn":0.0962962962962963,"lastEdited":1432234632258,"type":"txt","uuid":"5554e4a8e1b8325b2500115e","width":600,"wn":0.23020833333333332,"x":0,"xn":0.0203125,"y":0,"yn":0.8379629629629629},{"_id":{"$oid": "5554e6efe1b8325b25001170"},"content":" We don't know 100% that there actually is life in space. we have though about it but we can't come to the conclusion that there is life in space.

The sun is the main reason why life exists on Earth. Without the sun Earth would too cold to support life. All the water would freeze up. Plants would not be able to grow and make oxygen.\n Our planet is the perfect place to support life. The sun is not too far but it is not too close either. If it was too far our water would all freeze, plants would not grow and life could not exist. If we were too close, water would evaporate and all life would burn up.\n\n2. Water is necessary for life to exist on Earth. A liquid is needed for the chemical reaction that would make the earliest form of life. Water also provides life with something to drink. If we couldn't drink anything we would die within a week.\n\n3. Plants and trees produce oxygen. If there were no trees/plants then we would run out of oxygen, which we need to breathe. Plants also provide food for animals as well as us. We also eat animals. If there were no plants then the animals would run out of food and die. This would also make us starve because there would  be no more animals or plants to eat.\n\n4. All planets must have an atmosphere in order for life to survive. The atmosphere would protect the planet from asteroids, comets, harmful radiation, solar flares, meteors and other harmful things from space.

They are mostly near the constalation Segotarious. WR104 is the one closest to us and if and when it explodes it could be targeting our planet, the radiation come crack a hole in our ozone layer which could make many species extinct including ours. There are millions of Death Star in our universe. Death Stars are like giant nuclear bombs in the universe. Deaths stars explode in to a \"stellar after life.\" There explosions can blow up to be almost as big as a planet. How they blow up is because the thing that contains them slowly disappears and when it's gone all the gravity pushes everything to the middle and the Death Star explodes. If one targets earth with enough force it is possible that it could go right through the ozone layer and hit the earth. That is what could happen with WR104. WR104 is like a real Death Star from Star Wars but much scarier. WR104 is  something we call Wolf-Rayat Star. WR104 is next to a star called a Binary System Star. Both stars orbit each other, and these space wind degrad the mass from one star and the mass that is taken away  God to the other star next to it and the star that took all that mass from the other star is usually the star that explodes. There is a dust spiral that works like a giant spider that shoots water from one side and because it is spinning it becomes a spiral.

The core gets hotter and hotter, until nuclear reactions begin inside, making the cloud of gases a star.","height":193,"hn":0.23875,"lastEdited":1432222794188,"rotation":"0.0","type":"txt","uuid":"554b83daacba496065000008-txtitem","width":216,"wn":0.16875,"x":326,"xn":0.403125,"y":577,"yn":0.7225},{"_id":{"$oid": "554b8affe1b8325b25000ee6"},"content":"rtrt","type":"txt","uuid":"554b8ab4acba496cc6000015-txtitem"},{"_id":{"$oid": "554b86d9e1b8325b25000ec9"},"content":" The largest black holes are called a supermassive black hole.

Water is necessary for life to exist on Earth. A liquid is needed for the chemical reaction that would make the earliest form of life. Water also provides life with something to drink. If we couldn't drink anything we would die within a week.\n\n3. Plants and trees produce oxygen. If there were no trees/plants then we would run out of oxygen, which we need to breathe. Plants also provide food for animals as well as us. We also eat animals. If there were no plants then the animals would run out of food and die. This would also make us starve because there would  be no more animals or plants to eat.\n\n4. All planets must have an atmosphere in order for life to survive. The atmosphere would protect the planet from asteroids, comets, harmful radiation, solar flares, meteors and other harmful things from space.

The first person to discover dark matter was Fritz Zwicky, who was an astronomer from Switzerland. We know that mass bends light. The gravitational field of a massive object will extend far into space, and cause light rays passing close to that object to be bent and refocused somewhere else. The more massive the object, the stronger its gravitational field and so the greater the bending of light rays. Using the 340-megapixel camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) on Mauna Kea Mountain in Hawaii, scientists studied the gravitational lensing effects of 10 million galaxies in four different regions of the sky over a period of five years. When they stitched everything together, they had a picture of dark matter looking across 1 billion light-years of space - the largest map of the invisible stuff produced to date.\n\n      The ratio of dark matter to visible matter is 10:1! Dark matter makes up 23% of the universe whereas ordinary matter makes up only 4% . Dark matter effects galaxies movements. If galaxies didn't have dark matter to assist them they would rotate too fast. In other words dark matter makes sure galaxies do not rotate to fast by slowing them down.\n\n      Dark matter passes through the earth \"billions of particles at a time.\" Because dark matter is passing through the earth \"billions of particles at a time\" some of you might be wondering why can't we see it? That is because dark matter is an invisible substance. Some scientists who are working with a company called Fermilab are trying to capture dark matter in a substance called geranium the geranium is in a puck like shape. The dark matter will hopefully one day pass through the geranium puck and heat it up a tad because the geranium puck is frozen. Unfortunatly the propability of dark matter to pass through the geranium puck is like an archer trying to hit a bullseye a mile away.\n\n      Nobody knows what dark matter really is. Other candidates are figments of scientific imagination. One of the candidates are WIMPs (which stands for weakly interacting massive particles), and if they exist, these particles have masses tens or hundreds of times greater than that of a proton but interact so weakly with ordinary matter that they're difficult to detect.","height":1064,"hn":1.33,"lastEdited":1431601736680,"rotation":"0.0","type":"txt","uuid":"554ba40b5f740e680800000a-txtitem","width":307,"wn":0.23984375,"x":1612,"xn":1.259375,"y":21,"yn":0.02625},{"_id":{"$oid": "554ba7bce1b8325b25000f26"},"content":" In conclusion,\n\n~Dark matter has a gravitational pull!

In August, he demonstrated it to some Venetian merchants, who saw its value for spotting ships and gave Galileo salary to manufacture several of them. However, Galileo's ambition pushed him to go further, and in the fall of 1609 he made the fateful decision to turn his telescope toward the heavens. In March 1610, he published a small booklet, The Starry Messenger, revealing his discoveries that the moon was not flat and smooth, but a sphere with mountains and craters. He found Venus had phases like the moon, proving it rotated around the sun. He also discovered Jupiter had revolving moons, which did not revolve around the earth.

Evolved from the Draco Thruster, the SuperDraco Jetpack Engine is extremely powerful and can use fuel for months after takeoff. They can be found in SpaceX's most recent spacecrafts, and can possibly be used for space travel alongside the Ion Thrusters. For example, let's say that a spacecraft has both Ion Thrusters and SuperDraco Jetpack Engines. It could use the SuperDraco Engines to propel itself once it's in space while beginning to use the Ion Thrusters. As a result, it could be extremely fast when it takes off by using half of the fuel for the SuperDraco Engines, while the Ion Thrusters are gradually providing more of a push. Because only half of the fuel for the SuperDraco Engines would be used for the initial boost, when the ship lands, it could use the rest of the fuel for easy landing control.\n            The Draco Rocket Engine Family is SpaceX's group of Draco thrusters, which are hypergolic liquid rocket engines. Currently, there are only two members of the Draco Rocket Engine Family: The Draco Thruster, and the SuperDraco Jet"

Some people say that a few Biospherians smuggled food from the outside, and when the bees they had died cockroaches and ants replaced them.

Larger objects make bigger dents, which happen to be gravity. When there is a very big dent, all the smaller objects are being pulled into it, like a slant. The sun makes a very big dent, but it is farther away from the earth. The moon makes less of a dent, but it is way closer to the earth. Therefore, when the sun and the moon are in line on either sides of the earth, they are both pulling the earth, and earths water, towards themselves. This is what makes the tides go out. The reason that the water does not just fall straight off the earth is because earth has a dent of its own. Even though it is not that large, it still keeps the water coming back again. The way that it always comes back again is because the earth is spinning and losing line with the sun and the moon while the other parts of the world come into direction.\n ","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:33:18.813Z","height":751,"hn":0.46625,"lastEdited":1432224978722,"type":"txt","uuid":"555dfac1e1b8325b250011aa","width":600,"wn":0.23203125,"x":0,"xn":0.0203125,"y":0,"yn":0.32374996185302735},{"_id":{"$oid": "555df51be1b8325b25001197"},"content":"Blackholes are created when stars collapse.","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:09:35.671Z","height":35,"hn":0.04375,"lastEdited":1432224015334,"type":"txt","uuid":"555df51be1b8325b25001197","width":600,"wn":0.46875,"x":0,"xn":0.021875,"y":0,"yn":0.53125},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfc29e1b8325b250011b1"},"content":"a picture of the universe","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:39:16.920Z","type":"txt","uuid":"555dfc29e1b8325b250011b1"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfccce1b8325b250011b9"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1j373d0uj28.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:42:04.622Z","type":"img","uuid":"555dfccce1b8325b250011b9"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfc6ae1b8325b250011b3"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/uamwfupbeo.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:40:25.571Z","height":445,"hn":0.2212962962962963,"lastEdited":1432226645471,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfc6ae1b8325b250011b3","width":876,"wn":0.2453125,"x":0,"xn":0.20861018498738607,"y":0,"yn":0.7288187662760417},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfcb2e1b8325b250011b4"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1pgon59m1vk.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:41:37.811Z","height":181,"hn":0.22625,"lastEdited":1432224015338,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfcb2e1b8325b250011b4","width":279,"wn":0.21796875,"x":0,"xn":0.30546875,"y":0,"yn":0.25875},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfccce1b8325b250011b7"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/qy1iuhui2o.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:42:04.150Z","height":2448,"hn":0.33625,"lastEdited":1432224015352,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfccce1b8325b250011b7","width":3264,"wn":0.28125,"x":0,"xn":0.64765625,"y":0,"yn":0.01},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfdb1e1b8325b250011c3"},"content":" The universe is expanding into itself, there isn't any outside to the universe it is just space that the universe expanses into.

At an early age, Hawking showed a passion for science and the sky. At age 21, while studying cosmology at the University of Cambridge, he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Despite his debilitating illness, he has done groundbreaking work in physics and cosmology, and his several books have helped to make science accessible to everyone. Part of his life story was depicted in the 2014 film The Theory of Everything.\n\n- Groundbreaking findings from another young cosmologist, Roger Penrose, about the fate of stars and the creation of black holes tapped into Hawking's own fascination with how the universe began. This set him on a career course that reshaped the way the world thinks about black holes and the universe.\n\n- In 1974, Hawking's research turned him into a celebrity within the scientific world when he showed that black holes aren't the information vacuums that scientists had thought they were. In simple terms, Hawking demonstrated that matter, in the form of radiation, can escape the gravitational force of a collapsed star. Hawking radiation was born.\n\nWhat awards he has won: \nPresidential Medal of Freedom, Copley Medal, Wolf Prize in Physics, Fonseca Prize, Albert Einstein Award (twice!), Adams Prize, Gold Medal of the royal astronomical Society, Hughes Medal, eddington, Dannie Heineman Prize mathematical Physics, Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics and Life Sciences, Prince of asturias award for Concord, and dirac medal of the institute of Physics.","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:49:07.523Z","type":"txt","uuid":"555dfe73e1b8325b250011cd"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfcfbe1b8325b250011ba"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/qi0o97zkzk.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:42:50.144Z","height":227,"hn":0.17592592592592593,"lastEdited":1432226645460,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfcfbe1b8325b250011ba","width":350,"wn":0.15260416666666668,"x":0,"xn":0.20787722269694012,"y":0,"yn":0.16329284950538916},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfe72e1b8325b250011cb"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/c13079qu4g.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:49:04.025Z","height":1600,"hn":0.4759259259259259,"lastEdited":1432226645475,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfe72e1b8325b250011cb","width":2560,"wn":0.428125,"x":0,"xn":0.4839574178059896,"y":0,"yn":0.5712296097366898},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfe96e1b8325b250011ce"},"content":" - URANUS - Uranus was discovered  By Sir Williams Hershel -\n He was one of the most famous astronomers of the 18th century - \nHershel Discovered it with his hand crafted telescope 1781 - \nWilliams was a german born British - \nHe found Uranus and its two moons - \n\nUranus is known as the ice giant - \nIt takes 84 earth years to orbit the sun - \nIt's tempratures can be 216 C, making it the coldest of the major planets.","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:49:42.892Z","type":"txt","uuid":"555dfe96e1b8325b250011ce"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfefbe1b8325b250011d0"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1vpkpg96cxs.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:51:23.237Z","height":85,"hn":0.1475,"lastEdited":1432224015357,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfefbe1b8325b250011d0","width":81,"wn":0.08828125,"x":0,"xn":0.06667542457580566,"y":0,"yn":0.013468754291534425},{"_id":{"$oid": "555e0247e1b8325b250011d6"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/yprv046qkg.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T16:05:26.915Z","height":1024,"hn":0.36875,"lastEdited":1432224978697,"type":"img","uuid":"555e0247e1b8325b250011d6","width":748,"wn":0.16796875,"x":0,"xn":0.22845540046691895,"y":0,"yn":0.06930117130279541},{"_id":{"$oid": "555e00b7e1b8325b250011d4"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/v4syoi5vcw.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:58:46.945Z","height":1004,"hn":0.3075,"lastEdited":1432224978718,"type":"img","uuid":"555e00b7e1b8325b250011d4","width":832,"wn":0.159375,"x":0,"xn":0.6150905609130859,"y":0,"yn":0.3407368469238281},{"_id":{"$oid": "5554e48be1b8325b2500115d"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1oecqto579c.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-14T18:08:10.731Z","height":1536,"hn":0.2638888888888889,"lastEdited":1432234632252,"type":"img","uuid":"5554e48be1b8325b2500115d","width":2048,"wn":0.19791666666666666,"x":0,"xn":0.7770833333333333,"y":0,"yn":0.025925925925925925},{"_id":{"$oid": "5554e4a8e1b8325b2500115e"},"content":" www.seti.org\nyoutube\nwww.nasa.com\nwww.planet.com\nwww.universetoday.com\nhttp://ocean.si.edu/ocean-videos/hydrothermal-vent-creatures\nwww.space.com\n","created_at":"2015-05-14T18:08:40.021Z","height":143,"hn":0.0962962962962963,"lastEdited":1432234632258,"type":"txt","uuid":"5554e4a8e1b8325b2500115e","width":600,"wn":0.23020833333333332,"x":0,"xn":0.0203125,"y":0,"yn":0.8379629629629629},{"_id":{"$oid": "5554e6efe1b8325b25001170"},"content":" We don't know 100% that there actually is life in space. we have though about it but we can't come to the conclusion that there is life in space.

The sun is the main reason why life exists on Earth. Without the sun Earth would too cold to support life. All the water would freeze up. Plants would not be able to grow and make oxygen.\n Our planet is the perfect place to support life. The sun is not too far but it is not too close either. If it was too far our water would all freeze, plants would not grow and life could not exist. If we were too close, water would evaporate and all life would burn up.\n\n2. Water is necessary for life to exist on Earth. A liquid is needed for the chemical reaction that would make the earliest form of life. Water also provides life with something to drink. If we couldn't drink anything we would die within a week.\n\n3. Plants and trees produce oxygen. If there were no trees/plants then we would run out of oxygen, which we need to breathe. Plants also provide food for animals as well as us. We also eat animals. If there were no plants then the animals would run out of food and die. This would also make us starve because there would  be no more animals or plants to eat.\n\n4. All planets must have an atmosphere in order for life to survive. The atmosphere would protect the planet from asteroids, comets, harmful radiation, solar flares, meteors and other harmful things from space.

They are mostly near the constalation Segotarious. WR104 is the one closest to us and if and when it explodes it could be targeting our planet, the radiation come crack a hole in our ozone layer which could make many species extinct including ours. There are millions of Death Star in our universe. Death Stars are like giant nuclear bombs in the universe. Deaths stars explode in to a \"stellar after life.\" There explosions can blow up to be almost as big as a planet. How they blow up is because the thing that contains them slowly disappears and when it's gone all the gravity pushes everything to the middle and the Death Star explodes. If one targets earth with enough force it is possible that it could go right through the ozone layer and hit the earth. That is what could happen with WR104. WR104 is like a real Death Star from Star Wars but much scarier. WR104 is  something we call Wolf-Rayat Star. WR104 is next to a star called a Binary System Star. Both stars orbit each other, and these space wind degrad the mass from one star and the mass that is taken away  God to the other star next to it and the star that took all that mass from the other star is usually the star that explodes. There is a dust spiral that works like a giant spider that shoots water from one side and because it is spinning it becomes a spiral.

The core gets hotter and hotter, until nuclear reactions begin inside, making the cloud of gases a star.","height":193,"hn":0.23875,"lastEdited":1432222794188,"rotation":"0.0","type":"txt","uuid":"554b83daacba496065000008-txtitem","width":216,"wn":0.16875,"x":326,"xn":0.403125,"y":577,"yn":0.7225},{"_id":{"$oid": "554b8affe1b8325b25000ee6"},"content":"rtrt","type":"txt","uuid":"554b8ab4acba496cc6000015-txtitem"},{"_id":{"$oid": "554b86d9e1b8325b25000ec9"},"content":" The largest black holes are called a supermassive black hole.

Water is necessary for life to exist on Earth. A liquid is needed for the chemical reaction that would make the earliest form of life. Water also provides life with something to drink. If we couldn't drink anything we would die within a week.\n\n3. Plants and trees produce oxygen. If there were no trees/plants then we would run out of oxygen, which we need to breathe. Plants also provide food for animals as well as us. We also eat animals. If there were no plants then the animals would run out of food and die. This would also make us starve because there would  be no more animals or plants to eat.\n\n4. All planets must have an atmosphere in order for life to survive. The atmosphere would protect the planet from asteroids, comets, harmful radiation, solar flares, meteors and other harmful things from space.

The first person to discover dark matter was Fritz Zwicky, who was an astronomer from Switzerland. We know that mass bends light. The gravitational field of a massive object will extend far into space, and cause light rays passing close to that object to be bent and refocused somewhere else. The more massive the object, the stronger its gravitational field and so the greater the bending of light rays. Using the 340-megapixel camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) on Mauna Kea Mountain in Hawaii, scientists studied the gravitational lensing effects of 10 million galaxies in four different regions of the sky over a period of five years. When they stitched everything together, they had a picture of dark matter looking across 1 billion light-years of space - the largest map of the invisible stuff produced to date.\n\n      The ratio of dark matter to visible matter is 10:1! Dark matter makes up 23% of the universe whereas ordinary matter makes up only 4% . Dark matter effects galaxies movements. If galaxies didn't have dark matter to assist them they would rotate too fast. In other words dark matter makes sure galaxies do not rotate to fast by slowing them down.\n\n      Dark matter passes through the earth \"billions of particles at a time.\" Because dark matter is passing through the earth \"billions of particles at a time\" some of you might be wondering why can't we see it? That is because dark matter is an invisible substance. Some scientists who are working with a company called Fermilab are trying to capture dark matter in a substance called geranium the geranium is in a puck like shape. The dark matter will hopefully one day pass through the geranium puck and heat it up a tad because the geranium puck is frozen. Unfortunatly the propability of dark matter to pass through the geranium puck is like an archer trying to hit a bullseye a mile away.\n\n      Nobody knows what dark matter really is. Other candidates are figments of scientific imagination. One of the candidates are WIMPs (which stands for weakly interacting massive particles), and if they exist, these particles have masses tens or hundreds of times greater than that of a proton but interact so weakly with ordinary matter that they're difficult to detect.","height":1064,"hn":1.33,"lastEdited":1431601736680,"rotation":"0.0","type":"txt","uuid":"554ba40b5f740e680800000a-txtitem","width":307,"wn":0.23984375,"x":1612,"xn":1.259375,"y":21,"yn":0.02625},{"_id":{"$oid": "554ba7bce1b8325b25000f26"},"content":" In conclusion,\n\n~Dark matter has a gravitational pull!

In August, he demonstrated it to some Venetian merchants, who saw its value for spotting ships and gave Galileo salary to manufacture several of them. However, Galileo's ambition pushed him to go further, and in the fall of 1609 he made the fateful decision to turn his telescope toward the heavens. In March 1610, he published a small booklet, The Starry Messenger, revealing his discoveries that the moon was not flat and smooth, but a sphere with mountains and craters. He found Venus had phases like the moon, proving it rotated around the sun. He also discovered Jupiter had revolving moons, which did not revolve around the earth.

Evolved from the Draco Thruster, the SuperDraco Jetpack Engine is extremely powerful and can use fuel for months after takeoff. They can be found in SpaceX's most recent spacecrafts, and can possibly be used for space travel alongside the Ion Thrusters. For example, let's say that a spacecraft has both Ion Thrusters and SuperDraco Jetpack Engines. It could use the SuperDraco Engines to propel itself once it's in space while beginning to use the Ion Thrusters. As a result, it could be extremely fast when it takes off by using half of the fuel for the SuperDraco Engines, while the Ion Thrusters are gradually providing more of a push. Because only half of the fuel for the SuperDraco Engines would be used for the initial boost, when the ship lands, it could use the rest of the fuel for easy landing control.\n            The Draco Rocket Engine Family is SpaceX's group of Draco thrusters, which are hypergolic liquid rocket engines. Currently, there are only two members of the Draco Rocket Engine Family: The Draco Thruster, and the SuperDraco Jet"

Some people say that a few Biospherians smuggled food from the outside, and when the bees they had died cockroaches and ants replaced them.

Larger objects make bigger dents, which happen to be gravity. When there is a very big dent, all the smaller objects are being pulled into it, like a slant. The sun makes a very big dent, but it is farther away from the earth. The moon makes less of a dent, but it is way closer to the earth. Therefore, when the sun and the moon are in line on either sides of the earth, they are both pulling the earth, and earths water, towards themselves. This is what makes the tides go out. The reason that the water does not just fall straight off the earth is because earth has a dent of its own. Even though it is not that large, it still keeps the water coming back again. The way that it always comes back again is because the earth is spinning and losing line with the sun and the moon while the other parts of the world come into direction.\n ","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:33:18.813Z","height":751,"hn":0.46625,"lastEdited":1432224978722,"type":"txt","uuid":"555dfac1e1b8325b250011aa","width":600,"wn":0.23203125,"x":0,"xn":0.0203125,"y":0,"yn":0.32374996185302735},{"_id":{"$oid": "555df51be1b8325b25001197"},"content":"Blackholes are created when stars collapse.","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:09:35.671Z","height":35,"hn":0.04375,"lastEdited":1432224015334,"type":"txt","uuid":"555df51be1b8325b25001197","width":600,"wn":0.46875,"x":0,"xn":0.021875,"y":0,"yn":0.53125},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfc29e1b8325b250011b1"},"content":"a picture of the universe","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:39:16.920Z","type":"txt","uuid":"555dfc29e1b8325b250011b1"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfccce1b8325b250011b9"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1j373d0uj28.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:42:04.622Z","type":"img","uuid":"555dfccce1b8325b250011b9"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfc6ae1b8325b250011b3"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/uamwfupbeo.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:40:25.571Z","height":445,"hn":0.2212962962962963,"lastEdited":1432226645471,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfc6ae1b8325b250011b3","width":876,"wn":0.2453125,"x":0,"xn":0.20861018498738607,"y":0,"yn":0.7288187662760417},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfcb2e1b8325b250011b4"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1pgon59m1vk.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:41:37.811Z","height":181,"hn":0.22625,"lastEdited":1432224015338,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfcb2e1b8325b250011b4","width":279,"wn":0.21796875,"x":0,"xn":0.30546875,"y":0,"yn":0.25875},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfccce1b8325b250011b7"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/qy1iuhui2o.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:42:04.150Z","height":2448,"hn":0.33625,"lastEdited":1432224015352,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfccce1b8325b250011b7","width":3264,"wn":0.28125,"x":0,"xn":0.64765625,"y":0,"yn":0.01},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfdb1e1b8325b250011c3"},"content":" The universe is expanding into itself, there isn't any outside to the universe it is just space that the universe expanses into.

At an early age, Hawking showed a passion for science and the sky. At age 21, while studying cosmology at the University of Cambridge, he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Despite his debilitating illness, he has done groundbreaking work in physics and cosmology, and his several books have helped to make science accessible to everyone. Part of his life story was depicted in the 2014 film The Theory of Everything.\n\n- Groundbreaking findings from another young cosmologist, Roger Penrose, about the fate of stars and the creation of black holes tapped into Hawking's own fascination with how the universe began. This set him on a career course that reshaped the way the world thinks about black holes and the universe.\n\n- In 1974, Hawking's research turned him into a celebrity within the scientific world when he showed that black holes aren't the information vacuums that scientists had thought they were. In simple terms, Hawking demonstrated that matter, in the form of radiation, can escape the gravitational force of a collapsed star. Hawking radiation was born.\n\nWhat awards he has won: \nPresidential Medal of Freedom, Copley Medal, Wolf Prize in Physics, Fonseca Prize, Albert Einstein Award (twice!), Adams Prize, Gold Medal of the royal astronomical Society, Hughes Medal, eddington, Dannie Heineman Prize mathematical Physics, Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics and Life Sciences, Prince of asturias award for Concord, and dirac medal of the institute of Physics.","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:49:07.523Z","type":"txt","uuid":"555dfe73e1b8325b250011cd"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfcfbe1b8325b250011ba"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/qi0o97zkzk.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:42:50.144Z","height":227,"hn":0.17592592592592593,"lastEdited":1432226645460,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfcfbe1b8325b250011ba","width":350,"wn":0.15260416666666668,"x":0,"xn":0.20787722269694012,"y":0,"yn":0.16329284950538916},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfe72e1b8325b250011cb"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/c13079qu4g.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:49:04.025Z","height":1600,"hn":0.4759259259259259,"lastEdited":1432226645475,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfe72e1b8325b250011cb","width":2560,"wn":0.428125,"x":0,"xn":0.4839574178059896,"y":0,"yn":0.5712296097366898},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfe96e1b8325b250011ce"},"content":" - URANUS - Uranus was discovered  By Sir Williams Hershel -\n He was one of the most famous astronomers of the 18th century - \nHershel Discovered it with his hand crafted telescope 1781 - \nWilliams was a german born British - \nHe found Uranus and its two moons - \n\nUranus is known as the ice giant - \nIt takes 84 earth years to orbit the sun - \nIt's tempratures can be 216 C, making it the coldest of the major planets.","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:49:42.892Z","type":"txt","uuid":"555dfe96e1b8325b250011ce"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfefbe1b8325b250011d0"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1vpkpg96cxs.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:51:23.237Z","height":85,"hn":0.1475,"lastEdited":1432224015357,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfefbe1b8325b250011d0","width":81,"wn":0.08828125,"x":0,"xn":0.06667542457580566,"y":0,"yn":0.013468754291534425},{"_id":{"$oid": "555e0247e1b8325b250011d6"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/yprv046qkg.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T16:05:26.915Z","height":1024,"hn":0.36875,"lastEdited":1432224978697,"type":"img","uuid":"555e0247e1b8325b250011d6","width":748,"wn":0.16796875,"x":0,"xn":0.22845540046691895,"y":0,"yn":0.06930117130279541},{"_id":{"$oid": "555e00b7e1b8325b250011d4"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/v4syoi5vcw.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:58:46.945Z","height":1004,"hn":0.3075,"lastEdited":1432224978718,"type":"img","uuid":"555e00b7e1b8325b250011d4","width":832,"wn":0.159375,"x":0,"xn":0.6150905609130859,"y":0,"yn":0.3407368469238281},{"_id":{"$oid": "5554e48be1b8325b2500115d"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1oecqto579c.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-14T18:08:10.731Z","height":1536,"hn":0.2638888888888889,"lastEdited":1432234632252,"type":"img","uuid":"5554e48be1b8325b2500115d","width":2048,"wn":0.19791666666666666,"x":0,"xn":0.7770833333333333,"y":0,"yn":0.025925925925925925},{"_id":{"$oid": "5554e4a8e1b8325b2500115e"},"content":" www.seti.org\nyoutube\nwww.nasa.com\nwww.planet.com\nwww.universetoday.com\nhttp://ocean.si.edu/ocean-videos/hydrothermal-vent-creatures\nwww.space.com\n","created_at":"2015-05-14T18:08:40.021Z","height":143,"hn":0.0962962962962963,"lastEdited":1432234632258,"type":"txt","uuid":"5554e4a8e1b8325b2500115e","width":600,"wn":0.23020833333333332,"x":0,"xn":0.0203125,"y":0,"yn":0.8379629629629629},{"_id":{"$oid": "5554e6efe1b8325b25001170"},"content":" We don't know 100% that there actually is life in space. we have though about it but we can't come to the conclusion that there is life in space.

The sun is the main reason why life exists on Earth. Without the sun Earth would too cold to support life. All the water would freeze up. Plants would not be able to grow and make oxygen.\n Our planet is the perfect place to support life. The sun is not too far but it is not too close either. If it was too far our water would all freeze, plants would not grow and life could not exist. If we were too close, water would evaporate and all life would burn up.\n\n2. Water is necessary for life to exist on Earth. A liquid is needed for the chemical reaction that would make the earliest form of life. Water also provides life with something to drink. If we couldn't drink anything we would die within a week.\n\n3. Plants and trees produce oxygen. If there were no trees/plants then we would run out of oxygen, which we need to breathe. Plants also provide food for animals as well as us. We also eat animals. If there were no plants then the animals would run out of food and die. This would also make us starve because there would  be no more animals or plants to eat.\n\n4. All planets must have an atmosphere in order for life to survive. The atmosphere would protect the planet from asteroids, comets, harmful radiation, solar flares, meteors and other harmful things from space.

They are mostly near the constalation Segotarious. WR104 is the one closest to us and if and when it explodes it could be targeting our planet, the radiation come crack a hole in our ozone layer which could make many species extinct including ours. There are millions of Death Star in our universe. Death Stars are like giant nuclear bombs in the universe. Deaths stars explode in to a \"stellar after life.\" There explosions can blow up to be almost as big as a planet. How they blow up is because the thing that contains them slowly disappears and when it's gone all the gravity pushes everything to the middle and the Death Star explodes. If one targets earth with enough force it is possible that it could go right through the ozone layer and hit the earth. That is what could happen with WR104. WR104 is like a real Death Star from Star Wars but much scarier. WR104 is  something we call Wolf-Rayat Star. WR104 is next to a star called a Binary System Star. Both stars orbit each other, and these space wind degrad the mass from one star and the mass that is taken away  God to the other star next to it and the star that took all that mass from the other star is usually the star that explodes. There is a dust spiral that works like a giant spider that shoots water from one side and because it is spinning it becomes a spiral. The bigger the Death Star the faster less time it needs to explodes. Wr104 would explode in about a few hundred years and when it does it could be a Gamma-Rayat Burst. A GRB is triggered by the crushing transformation of a dieing star.","height":1292,"hn":0.4661458333333333,"lastEdited":1432231490829,"rotation":"0.0","type":"txt","uuid":"553e5ade39a868401b000001-txtitem","width":528,"wn":0.1181640625,"x":246,"xn":0.046875,"y":331,"yn":0.4192708333333333},{"_id":{"$oid": "553e5d4ae1b8325b25000cdb"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/rcwylzln9c.png","type":"img","uuid":"553e5d363d1561355e000035-mediaitem"},{"_id":{"$oid": "553932dce1b8325b25000c9e"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/px3k32m80.jpg","height":372,"lastEdited":0,"rotation":"0.0","type":"img","uuid":"553932c7f079d013c8000005-mediaitem","width":281,"x":438,"y":236},{"_id":{"$oid": "553e5c0fe1b8325b25000ccd"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/57fsg6u60w.jpg","height":490,"lastEdited":0,"rotation":"0.0","type":"img","uuid":"553e5bdf48cedc3c69000007-mediaitem","width":401,"x":499,"y":-20},{"_id":{"$oid": "553e6"

For this reason, an observer inside a black hole experiences the passage of time much differently than an outside observer. Imagine you want to investigate a black hole by shining a light towards it and measuring the time that elapses before the light is reflected back to you. Unfortunately, you will be waiting a very long time[0xc3][0xa2][0xc2][0x80][0xc2][0x94]forever, in fact.

The first person to discover dark matter was Fritz Zwicky, who was an astronomer from Switzerland. We know that mass bends light. The gravitational field of a massive object will extend far into space, and cause light rays passing close to that object to be bent and refocused somewhere else. The more massive the object, the stronger its gravitational field and so the greater the bending of light rays. Using the 340-megapixel camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) on Mauna Kea Mountain in Hawaii, scientists studied the gravitational lensing effects of 10 million galaxies in four different regions of the sky over a period of five years. When they stitched everything together, they had a picture of dark matter looking across 1 billion light-years of space - the largest map of the invisible stuff produced to date.\n\n      The ratio of dark matter to visible matter is 10:1! Dark matter makes up 23% of the universe whereas ordinary matter makes up only 4% . Dark matter effects galaxies movements. If galaxies didn't have dark matter to assist them they would rotate too fast. In other words dark matter makes sure galaxies do not rotate to fast by slowing them down.\n\n      Dark matter passes through the earth \"billions of particles at a time.\" Because dark matter is passing through the earth \"billions of particles at a time\" some of you might be wondering why can't we see it? That is because dark matter is an invisible substance. Some scientists who are working with a company called Fermilab are trying to capture dark matter in a substance called geranium the geranium is in a puck like shape. The dark matter will hopefully one day pass through the geranium puck and heat it up a tad because the geranium puck is frozen. Unfortunatly the propability of dark matter to pass through the geranium puck is like an archer trying to hit a bullseye a mile away.\n\n      Nobody knows what dark matter really is. Other candidates are figments of scientific imagination. One of the candidates are WIMPs (which stands for weakly interacting massive particles), and if they exist, these particles have masses tens or hundreds of times greater than that of a proton but interact so weakly with ordinary matter that they're difficult to detect.","height":1064,"hn":1.33,"lastEdited":1431601736680,"rotation":"0.0","type":"txt","uuid":"554ba40b5f740e680800000a-txtitem","width":307,"wn":0.23984375,"x":1612,"xn":1.259375,"y":21,"yn":0.02625},{"_id":{"$oid": "554ba7bce1b8325b25000f26"},"content":" In conclusion,\n\n~Dark matter has a gravitational pull!

In August, he demonstrated it to some Venetian merchants, who saw its value for spotting ships and gave Galileo salary to manufacture several of them. However, Galileo's ambition pushed him to go further, and in the fall of 1609 he made the fateful decision to turn his telescope toward the heavens. In March 1610, he published a small booklet, The Starry Messenger, revealing his discoveries that the moon was not flat and smooth, but a sphere with mountains and craters. He found Venus had phases like the moon, proving it rotated around the sun. He also discovered Jupiter had revolving moons, which did not revolve around the earth.

For example, let's say that a spacecraft has both Ion Thrusters and SuperDraco Jetpack Engines. It could use the SuperDraco Engines to propel itself once it's in space while beginning to use the Ion Thrusters. As a result, it could be extremely fast when it takes off by using half of the fuel for the SuperDraco Engines, while the Ion Thrusters are gradually providing more of a push. Because only half of the fuel for the SuperDraco Engines would be used for the initial boost, when the ship lands, it could use the rest of the fuel for easy landing control.\n            The Draco Rocket Engine Family is SpaceX's group of Draco thrusters, which are hypergolic liquid rocket engines.

Some people say that a few Biospherians smuggled food from the outside, and when the bees they had died cockroaches and ants replaced them.

Larger objects make bigger dents, which happen to be gravity. When there is a very big dent, all the smaller objects are being pulled into it, like a slant. The sun makes a very big dent, but it is farther away from the earth. The moon makes less of a dent, but it is way closer to the earth. Therefore, when the sun and the moon are in line on either sides of the earth, they are both pulling the earth, and earths water, towards themselves. This is what makes the tides go out. The reason that the water does not just fall straight off the earth is because earth has a dent of its own. Even though it is not that large, it still keeps the water coming back again. The way that it always comes back again is because the earth is spinning and losing line with the sun and the moon while the other parts of the world come into direction.\n ","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:33:18.813Z","height":751,"hn":0.46625,"lastEdited":1432224978722,"type":"txt","uuid":"555dfac1e1b8325b250011aa","width":600,"wn":0.23203125,"x":0,"xn":0.0203125,"y":0,"yn":0.32374996185302735},{"_id":{"$oid": "555df51be1b8325b25001197"},"content":"Blackholes are created when stars collapse.","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:09:35.671Z","height":35,"hn":0.04375,"lastEdited":1432224015334,"type":"txt","uuid":"555df51be1b8325b25001197","width":600,"wn":0.46875,"x":0,"xn":0.021875,"y":0,"yn":0.53125},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfc29e1b8325b250011b1"},"content":"a picture of the universe","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:39:16.920Z","type":"txt","uuid":"555dfc29e1b8325b250011b1"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfccce1b8325b250011b9"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1j373d0uj28.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:42:04.622Z","type":"img","uuid":"555dfccce1b8325b250011b9"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfc6ae1b8325b250011b3"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/uamwfupbeo.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:40:25.571Z","height":445,"hn":0.2212962962962963,"lastEdited":1432226645471,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfc6ae1b8325b250011b3","width":876,"wn":0.2453125,"x":0,"xn":0.20861018498738607,"y":0,"yn":0.7288187662760417},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfcb2e1b8325b250011b4"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1pgon59m1vk.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:41:37.811Z","height":181,"hn":0.22625,"lastEdited":1432224015338,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfcb2e1b8325b250011b4","width":279,"wn":0.21796875,"x":0,"xn":0.30546875,"y":0,"yn":0.25875},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfccce1b8325b250011b7"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/qy1iuhui2o.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:42:04.150Z","height":2448,"hn":0.33625,"lastEdited":1432224015352,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfccce1b8325b250011b7","width":3264,"wn":0.28125,"x":0,"xn":0.64765625,"y":0,"yn":0.01},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfdb1e1b8325b250011c3"},"content":" The universe is expanding into itself, there isn't any outside to the universe it is just space that the universe expanses into.

At an early age, Hawking showed a passion for science and the sky. At age 21, while studying cosmology at the University of Cambridge, he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Despite his debilitating illness, he has done groundbreaking work in physics and cosmology, and his several books have helped to make science accessible to everyone. Part of his life story was depicted in the 2014 film The Theory of Everything.\n\n- Groundbreaking findings from another young cosmologist, Roger Penrose, about the fate of stars and the creation of black holes tapped into Hawking's own fascination with how the universe began. This set him on a career course that reshaped the way the world thinks about black holes and the universe.\n\n- In 1974, Hawking's research turned him into a celebrity within the scientific world when he showed that black holes aren't the information vacuums that scientists had thought they were. In simple terms, Hawking demonstrated that matter, in the form of radiation, can escape the gravitational force of a collapsed star. Hawking radiation was born.\n\nWhat awards he has won: \nPresidential Medal of Freedom, Copley Medal, Wolf Prize in Physics, Fonseca Prize, Albert Einstein Award (twice!), Adams Prize, Gold Medal of the royal astronomical Society, Hughes Medal, eddington, Dannie Heineman Prize mathematical Physics, Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics and Life Sciences, Prince of asturias award for Concord, and dirac medal of the institute of Physics.","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:49:07.523Z","type":"txt","uuid":"555dfe73e1b8325b250011cd"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfcfbe1b8325b250011ba"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/qi0o97zkzk.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:42:50.144Z","height":227,"hn":0.17592592592592593,"lastEdited":1432226645460,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfcfbe1b8325b250011ba","width":350,"wn":0.15260416666666668,"x":0,"xn":0.20787722269694012,"y":0,"yn":0.16329284950538916},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfe72e1b8325b250011cb"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/c13079qu4g.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:49:04.025Z","height":1600,"hn":0.4759259259259259,"lastEdited":1432226645475,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfe72e1b8325b250011cb","width":2560,"wn":0.428125,"x":0,"xn":0.4839574178059896,"y":0,"yn":0.5712296097366898},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfe96e1b8325b250011ce"},"content":" - URANUS - Uranus was discovered  By Sir Williams Hershel -\n He was one of the most famous astronomers of the 18th century - \nHershel Discovered it with his hand crafted telescope 1781 - \nWilliams was a german born British - \nHe found Uranus and its two moons - \n\nUranus is known as the ice giant - \nIt takes 84 earth years to orbit the sun - \nIt's tempratures can be 216 C, making it the coldest of the major planets.","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:49:42.892Z","type":"txt","uuid":"555dfe96e1b8325b250011ce"},{"_id":{"$oid": "555dfefbe1b8325b250011d0"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1vpkpg96cxs.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:51:23.237Z","height":85,"hn":0.1475,"lastEdited":1432224015357,"type":"img","uuid":"555dfefbe1b8325b250011d0","width":81,"wn":0.08828125,"x":0,"xn":0.06667542457580566,"y":0,"yn":0.013468754291534425},{"_id":{"$oid": "555e0247e1b8325b250011d6"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/yprv046qkg.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T16:05:26.915Z","height":1024,"hn":0.36875,"lastEdited":1432224978697,"type":"img","uuid":"555e0247e1b8325b250011d6","width":748,"wn":0.16796875,"x":0,"xn":0.22845540046691895,"y":0,"yn":0.06930117130279541},{"_id":{"$oid": "555e00b7e1b8325b250011d4"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/v4syoi5vcw.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-21T15:58:46.945Z","height":1004,"hn":0.3075,"lastEdited":1432224978718,"type":"img","uuid":"555e00b7e1b8325b250011d4","width":832,"wn":0.159375,"x":0,"xn":0.6150905609130859,"y":0,"yn":0.3407368469238281},{"_id":{"$oid": "5554e48be1b8325b2500115d"},"content":"https://pikachu.coati.encorelab.org/1oecqto579c.jpg","created_at":"2015-05-14T18:08:10.731Z","height":1536,"hn":0.2638888888888889,"lastEdited":1432234632252,"type":"img","uuid":"5554e48be1b8325b2500115d","width":2048,"wn":0.19791666666666666,"x":0,"xn":0.7770833333333333,"y":0,"yn":0.025925925925925925},{"_id":{"$oid": "5554e4a8e1b8325b2500115e"},"content":" www.seti.org\nyoutube\nwww.nasa.com\nwww.planet.com\nwww.universetoday.com\nhttp://ocean.si.edu/ocean-videos/hydrothermal-vent-creatures\nwww.space.com\n","created_at":"2015-05-14T18:08:40.021Z","height":143,"hn":0.0962962962962963,"lastEdited":1432234632258,"type":"txt","uuid":"5554e4a8e1b8325b2500115e","width":600,"wn":0.23020833333333332,"x":0,"xn":0.0203125,"y":0,"yn":0.8379629629629629},{"_id":{"$oid": "5554e6efe1b8325b25001170"},"content":" We don't know 100% that there actually is life in space. we have though about it but we can't come to the conclusion that there is life in space.

The sun is the main reason why life exists on Earth. Without the sun Earth would too cold to support life. All the water would freeze up. Plants would not be able to grow and make oxygen.\n Our planet is the perfect place to support life. The sun is not too far but it is not too close either. If it was too far our water would all freeze, plants would not grow and life could not exist. If we were too close, water would evaporate and all life would burn up.\n\n2. Water is necessary for life to exist on Earth. A liquid is needed for the chemical reaction that would make the earliest form of life. Water also provides life with something to drink. If we couldn't drink anything we would die within a week.\n\n3. Plants and trees produce oxygen. If there were no trees/plants then we would run out of oxygen, which we need to breathe. Plants also provide food for animals as well as us. We also eat animals. If there were no plants then the animals would run out of food and die. This would also make us starve because there would  be no more animals or plants to eat.\n\n4. All planets must have an atmosphere in order for life to survive. The atmosphere would protect the planet from asteroids, comets, harmful radiation, solar flares, meteors and other harmful things from space.
